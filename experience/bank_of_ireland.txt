During my time at Bank of Ireland, I worked extensively with Python, SQL, and Apache PySpark to process and manage large datasets. I also gained hands-on experience with Unix, transferring and organizing files, and using Git for version control through Bitbucket. Each task had its own branch linked to Jira tickets, and all code changes went through peer-reviewed pull requests before being merged into the main branch. Daily stand-ups and ongoing communication were integral to the workflow, ensuring collaboration across teams.

I was involved in three main projects. The first was a data migration project, moving anti-human-trafficking data from Bank of Ireland’s data warehouse into their data lake. I wrote SQL to extract the data in partitions into staging files, and then additional SQL to ingest it into the data lake. These workflows were orchestrated using Oozie within HUE, a graphical interface for Unix tasks. To validate the migration, I used PySpark to check that counts and data integrity matched during UAT.

The second project focused on mortgage data. Here, I worked with APIs built on Flask, which needed to be refactored to FastAPI to comply with new data format requirements using Pydantic. The API I built received customer data and flagged potential loan defaults, which was then sent to another team for analysis.

For the third project, I built an API from scratch that sent mortgage data to external entities. This included CRIF, a global credit bureau, and nCino, a U.S.-based cloud banking platform used by Irish banks. Additionally, the data needed to be reported to the Central Bank of Ireland, ensuring regulatory compliance. I wrote the code using Pydantic to match the schema for PUT requests as specified by CRIF and nCino documentation. This was highly object-oriented and organized as a Python package, with multiple functions handling different use cases, such as student loans or other types of mortgages. I also conducted extensive user acceptance testing with many test cases, and the project was successfully delivered.

Throughout all these projects, version control, peer reviews, Jira ticket management, and daily stand-ups were part of the routine, and I actively contributed to all phases of development, testing, and delivery.
